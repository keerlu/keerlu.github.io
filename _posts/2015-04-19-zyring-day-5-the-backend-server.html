<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Get to know your backend server</h2>
<p>This tutorial is more just a 'read-and-understand' job, which was a nice change of pace after yesterday. I'm introduced to the apartment data I'll be using, which is in a JSON file hosted on the backend server and has the obvious stuff like price, location, photo and description.</p>
<p>I also read a bit of stuff about the HTTP protocol.</p>
<h2>Creating an Angular Factory</h2>
<p>In this tutorial I started on the 'M' bit of MVC, making a new directory to put our model code in. This will be the bit of the code that connects to the backend. Inside this directory I put a javascript file containing something called a <em>factory</em>, which is some Angular jargon I currently know nothing about. As I don't really know what this is yet, I didn't know what to call the file, so currently it's <code>rename_me_later.js</code>. Then I stuck in an empty <code>factory()</code> method.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this all makes more sense when used in context later, as with the 'Communicating with Controllers' tutorial which was also a bit abstract.</p>
