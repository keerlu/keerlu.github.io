<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Using dependency injection in Angular</h2>
<p>Hm, this one is still pretty abstract too. I'm apparently going to want to use something called the <code>$resource</code> function to connect with the backend server, and I want to refer to it using my factory defined in the previous tutorial. I'm still very unclear on what any of this stuff actually <em>is</em>, though, so hopefully things will start being connected up to the rest of the application soon.</p>
<h2>Attaching a $resource to all apartments URL</h2>
<p>Bit of a weird title, but this looks like what I was hoping for, a concrete connection to what I'm doing in the app. I connected up <code>$resource</code> to the backend server URL <code>spidey.zyring.com/cities</code> so I can use it to get apartment data. Still a bit confused about the connection to the previous tutorial on dependency injection, but hopefully I've got it right.</p>
