<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Google Maps API key</h2>
<p>Nice easy step here - obtain a key for the Google Maps API. OK, this was actually slightly more complicated than expected as Google's instructions appear to be out of date, and the actual process was a bit different... not too much of a challenge though.</p>
<h2>Installing a Google Maps directive</h2>
<p>Another setup-type tutorial here, though again somewhat confusing. The particular page of of documentation linked to was for something called the <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api">Google Maps Asynchronous Loader</a>, but I don't know whether that is something to install on its own or as part of the <code>angular-google-maps</code> package. Anyway I just installed <code>angular-google-maps</code> with bower using the <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/use">instructions</a> on the Quickstart page. I originally didn't read the bit about not needing to update <code>index.html</code> manually but that didn't really matter, it was kind of useful to dig around the files and see where everything was saved anyway.</p>
<p>After that it was time to actually include some maps! Again, I followed the Quickstart instructions, using my API key from the previous step, and it went pretty smoothly - I now have a map (of Montreal) at the top of the page for each city.</p>

<h2>Centring Google Maps</h2>
<p>This just involved moving the map from Montreal to Seattle. I was mildly surprised that Seattle is a good way north of Montreal, but other than that not much to report here.</p>
