<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Adding pins to Google Maps</h2>
<p>Another straightforward one that does what it says on the tin, though I needed to view the example <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26374723/angular-google-maps-v2-0-1-markers-directive-label-will-not-display-when-hovered">here</a> to work out exactly how to do it. Now I have some markers on the map!</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/screenshot_seattle_markers.png' alt="Map of Seattle with markers to show apartment locations" />
    <figcaption>Markers showing apartment locations</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The current map settings aren't ideal, though, because Tacoma and Olympia are off the map. For now I just zoom out a bit (zoom level 8 instead of 10). Now the Olympia markers are visible:</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/screenshot_olympia_markers.png' alt="Zoomed out to show Olympia" />
    <figcaption>Zoomed out to show Olympia</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Add overlays to your pin</h2>
<p>This time I'm adding windows that pop up when a marker is clicked on, with some information like a picture of the apartment and the price. This uses the <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api">ui-gmap-windows</a> directive and is again pretty simple to set up.</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/screenshot_marker_windows.png' alt="Map with pop-up description showing a photo and the price of each apartment" />
    <figcaption>Now with pop-up descriptions</figcaption>
</figure>
