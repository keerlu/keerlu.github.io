<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>"Add a pager UI elements"</h2>
<p>Oddly phrased title, but this tutorial involves adding some UI controls for the pagination I did in the last tutorial - the usual "Previous | 1 | 2 | 3 | Next" type stuff. This can be done through an external library, <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/top">Angular UI Bootstrap</a>, which I install through <code>bower</code>.</p>
<p>That goes ok, but then I forget to add the dependency to my <code>app.js</code> file and don't figure out what the problem isÂ for ages... I can see this becoming a theme. Even after this I get some errors, and discover I've loaded the wrong version of the library through <code>bower</code>: I need to install 'angular-bootstrap' rather than <code>ui.bootstrap</code>.</p>
<p>Once again, Stack Overflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22178753/adding-ui-bootstrap-dependency-with-bower">comes to the rescue</a>. After this, I have a nice bar of page numbers to click on:<br />

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/pagination_ui.png' alt="UI element for changing pages" />
    <figcaption>UI element for changing pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course, it doesn't actually <em>do</em> anything, yet, but it looks like that'll be the next tutorial...</p>
