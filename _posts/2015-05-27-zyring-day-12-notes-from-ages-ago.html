<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<p>So there's been a pretty long break in these blog entries - I'm doing some marking for a local university and just got hit by a huge pile of engineering maths exam scripts. That's over now, and I don't want to see another Fourier series for a while. Here I'm just writing up a short note I found from before Marking Fest started.</p>
<h2>Using the pager element to navigate</h2>
<p>Now it's a case of wiring everything up so that the page selection UI actually does something, using <code>ng-repeat</code>. This took me a little while just to work out what's going on, but was not actually very complicated in the end. My main annoyance was introducing some kind of off-by-one error so that the first page of apartments was missed off. Need to fix this sometime...</p>
