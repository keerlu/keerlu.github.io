<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Styling the Apartments List page</h2>
<p>Strangely, I wasn't really enthralled by the prospect of figuring out the off-by-one error from the last tutorial I did three weeks ago, so I decided to ease myself back in by doing a relatively self-contained tutorial on styling. I don't want to spend ages on styling as it's really not the focus of what I want to learn right now, but I will at least implement a basic grid of apartments.</p>
<p>I follow the same basic approach as for styling the list of cities, and this is what I end up with:</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/apartment_list_styling.png' alt="Basic styling for the list of apartments" />
    <figcaption>Basic styling for the list of apartments</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not exciting, but it'll do for now.</p>
<p>I also decide I don't like the circles on the Cities page, so I go for 'beer mats' throughout:</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/beermats.png' alt="Images for cities now have rounded corners" />
    <figcaption>I like beer.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>OK, this has hopefully got me back into the right mindset for this project.</p>
