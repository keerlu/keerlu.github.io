<p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Display information about a single apartment on a page (continued)</h2>
<p>Boom! Used <code>simonykq</code>'s solution on this <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/1350">thread</a> and it worked beautifully. Nice to start the day with something working immediately.</p>
<p>I then ran into another issue that needed fixing - a problem with duplicate items in lists when using <code>ng-repeat</code>. This could <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/error/ngRepeat/dupes">be fixed</a> by using the <code>track by $index</code> option, tracking by an object's position in an array rather than its value. I'd seen this error come up before, nice to understand it!</p>
<p>OK, finally time to style the information a bit. I get as far as this:</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/abbey_rowe.png' alt="Example apartment listing" />
    <figcaption>Example apartment listing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next time I plan to make this a bit fancier and more consistent with the styling of the previous pages. And hopefully find that off-by-one error... very close to finishing now!</p>
