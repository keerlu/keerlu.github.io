   <h2> Zyring Day 2 - styling  with Bootstrap </h2>

    <p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Styling Your Cities Page</h2>
<p>There's not much instruction given here, but I've played with CSS and Bootstrap a little bit before and am happy to just start mucking around. I generally enjoy thinking about design and layout and spent plenty of time messing around making posters in LaTeX or vector graphics in Inkscape during my PhD.</p>
<p>I'm going to aim for a simple layout a bit like this:</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/page_sketch.jpg' alt="Rubbish sketch of a page" />
    <figcaption>High quality mockup of my page</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So first I need to make a 3x2 grid, which I know how to do if I was going to manually specify what goes in each box. However, in this case what I really want to do is just populate it automatically with stuff from the controller, keeping it in three columns. This took me a while to figure out - I used this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20137496/angular-js-ng-repeat-for-creating-grid">StackOverflow question</a> for guidance, but that initially caused me to overcomplicate things a bit.</p>
<p>Anyway once I got that working it was down to playing with styling -- this took me ages as I'm still quite new to it, but it wasn't hard to google for relevant tutorials for things like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/">adding a darker background to the city names</a> to make them more readable.</p>
<p>What I ended up with wasn't great and needs to be fitted to the screen better, but it'll do as a start - I don't want to spend forever on styling right now as I'm keen to get into the mechanics of the site.</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/website_screenshot.png' alt="Website screenshot" />
    <figcaption>Well, it's a step up from the hand-drawn one...</figcaption>
