   <h2> Zyring Day 15 - Making pages for each apartment </h2>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Creating new pages for your apartments</h2>
<p>This took me a while, as it was some time since I'd done the routing for the city pages. I had to create my new view (<code>apartments.html</code>), my new controller (<code>apartments.js</code>) and then sort out the routing in <code>app.js</code>. Then I made links from each apartment in the map and listings to the new page. Think I'm starting to get the hang of how routing works!</p>
<h2>Backend endpoints for individual apartment API</h2>
<p>Nice short tutorial, just having a look at what information the backend server has for each apartment (quite a lot, as it turns out).</p>
<h2>Single apartment factory</h2>
<p>This is an odd tutorial. The text looks unfinished, and says 'Similar to the previous step, create another factory for the last backend call inside the script you created.' I have no idea what step this is referring to. I decide to go for my standby method of just guessing what to do, and then hoping the next tutorial makes more sense...</p>
<p>My guess is that I need to wire things up to the backend server using the <code>$resource</code> object, as I did for the apartment lists for each city. After a lot of fiddling around trying to remember how to do this, I manage to dump all the apartment data into my view for each apartment:</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/single_apartment_page.png' alt="Data for the single apartment view" />
    <figcaption>Data for the single apartment view</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not pretty. But it works!</p>
<h2>Getting information for individual apartments</h2>
<p>Hang on, turns out that the next tutorial is exactly what I just did. So I've now got <em>no idea</em> what the 'Single Apartment Factory' tutorial is about. Never mind, if it's important I'm sure I'll find out later. I'm also feeling quite smug that I figured out to use a <code>get</code> rather than <code>query</code> method by myself, with no help from the tutorial (it took me a while though).</p>
<p>Wow, there's only one tutorial left now (as well as going back and working out what my off-by-one problem with 'Using the pager element to navigate' is). Will leave this for another day, as I expect it will take some time to do all the styling and so on.</p>
