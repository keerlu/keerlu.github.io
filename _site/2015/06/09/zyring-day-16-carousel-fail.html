    <p><em>[Note: These are more in-depth (read: tedious) write-ups of my experience with each section of the Zyring project, leading on from my <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/wot-i-dun-zyring-project/">intro post</a> on Zyring. This is mostly for my own benefit but could conceivably be of use to someone doing the project.]</em></p>
<h2>Display information about a single apartment on a page</h2>
<p>Thought this would be straightforward, but I ended up having a fairly frustrating day of getting things wrong. Annoying when I seem to be so close to the end...</p>
<p>I decided I wanted a layout like this (written on a blank page of a 'Libraries for the Future' consultation booklet because I didn't bring any paper with me):</p>

<figure>
    <img src='/assets/apartment_page_layout.jpg' alt="Layout for my apartment page" />
    <figcaption>Layout for my apartment page</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fairly basic, just a title, a big carousel of images, and a couple of lists of information.</p>
<p>First I was confused for quite a while about why no apartment images were being displayed. I thought that for some reason <code>get</code> wasn't fetching them, and spent a long time mucking about with callbacks (on the plus side, they started making a lot more sense). Then I realised that the problem was simply that there aren't any images on the server for most apartments, just an empty array. So I decided to start off just getting the view for the <a href="http://spidey.zyring.com/apartments/ci53gwdpa006m66lvl1abui8z">example data</a> to work properly, and then think about what to do for the pages without images later.</p>
<p>For the carousel I tried to use the Angular Bootstrap library. My blog came in handy there: I knew I'd used it before but couldn't remember what for, so the <a href="https://wotidun.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/zyring-day-11-ui-controls-for-my-pages/">relevant post</a> was useful. I managed to include a carousel, but the arrows weren't working properly. I think it probably has something to do with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22641834/angularjs-corousel-stops-working">this problem</a>, but by now I'm happy to give this a rest for a while.</p>
