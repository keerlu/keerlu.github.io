  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
  I'm working as a programmer in Bristol, UK. Prior to that I did my PhD on gravitational waves in the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/stag/about/research-gravity.page">Gravity Group</a> at the University of Southampton, and still think about physics a lot.

  I'm planning to use this site to host notes on subjects I'm interested in and experiment with website design.
