  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>Hi! I work as a programmer in Bristol, UK. Before that I did my PhD in physics at the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/research/projects/general_relativity.page">General Relativity group</a> at the University of Southampton, working on modelling gravitational waves from neutron stars. I still enjoy learning physics, and particularly like quantum foundations, differential geometry, and building up intuition for topics I previously only learnt in a formal, 'here are the equations' sort of way.</p>
  
<p>I'm trying to get into the habit of writing up my notes in a more coherent form, instead of leaving them half-baked in old exercise books somewhere, so I made a site for it. (It's also a good excuse to experiment with website design.)</p>  
  
<p>If you have any other questions (or find any typos, dodgy equations, layout bugs or outright wrong claims!) please contact me <a href="mailto:lucy.keer@gmail.com">here.</a></p>
  
  <h2>About the site</h2>
  <p>To make the site I use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate a static site, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for hosting</li>
    <li><a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> for the kaleidoscope background on the homepage, with a lot of prototyping in <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> to figure out what I want</li>
    <li><a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte-CSS</a> for responsive sidenotes</li>
  </ul>
