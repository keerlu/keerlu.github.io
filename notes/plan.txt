- pick totalNumberSymbols between 6 and 10.

- while symbolList.length() =< totalNumberSymbols:

	1. generate a symbol with arbitrary size + rotation within the bbox of 		the big triangle
	2. find its (current, rotated) bbox
        3. find corners of bbox
	4. if all corners are within the big triangle:	
		add to symbolList
