  <h1>Spekkens toy model</h1>
  <p>This is a test of responsive sidenotes from <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a>... sample text from there follows. One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
   <p>Last time I talked a bit about this paper by van Enk that I’m concentrating on understanding this year. This paper is an extension of a more well-known paper by Robert Spekkens, which is a favourite of mine. It introduces a very simple toy model - literally just four boxes and a rule about how much knowledge we can obtain - which reproduces a number of the counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics (not all of them though). This month I’m just going to introduce the basic setup of the model that’s needed to understand the van Enk model - I won’t really get on to what you can do with it.

None of this section requires an understanding of quantum mechanics. It’s just a thing that could be in one of four boxes.

We can think of these four boxes as being arranged in a fully Ribbonfarm-compliant 2x2 as follows:
