  	      I made a *very* feeble attempt to try Anki after reading @michael_nielsen's essay, and weirdly the first cards I made were the Pauli matrices (always forget them). Quickly gave up as I didn't really get the point. <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html</a>

  	      Rereading it makes a lot more sense with the context of the quantum computing example. Going to play around with it for notetaking for a paper or something.
