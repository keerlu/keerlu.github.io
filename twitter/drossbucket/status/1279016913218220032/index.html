  	      @xuenay @Meaningness @everytstudies He just states that they can be sorted by colour, shape, etc...<br><br>Same in the previous essay, 'Cluster Structure of Thingspace' (spent time thinking about this one before and have a rant ready to go). He assumes that there is a state space for the robin.

  	      @xuenay @Meaningness @everytstudies *Once* you've got that state space, you can e.g. define a metric on it and look for clusters. Or look at probability distributions on it. Yudkowsky mostly talks about that sort of thing. @Meaningness is mostly interested in how you pick a state space in the first place

  	      @xuenay @Meaningness @everytstudies So for the bleggs/rubes his interest is in how you come up with a classification in the first place - how you stabilise the mess of sense data you receive about them into objects. Yudkowsky doesn't talk much about that afaict. Positivism had same issue.

  	      @xuenay @Meaningness @everytstudies I do agree that in that blegg/rube story he shows an understanding that classification is purpose-dependent: it's the vanadium/palladium core that's important. <br><br>He just doesn't seem to take that anywhere much in his writings.
