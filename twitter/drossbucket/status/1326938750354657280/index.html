  	      I'm writing something up and finding it hard. Partly just standard issue 2020 lockdown slowness, but mostly knowing I need to show it to people after and not wanting to.

  	      Some issues: 1. if you're out of a subfield it's really hard to know what's generally known in it and what isn't. Easy to end up with some result from the ghost library, and hard to judge whether something is actually interesting or useful.<br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1315970411864248323">https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1315970411864248323</a>

  	      3. Actually this one goes pretty deep. I'm very attached to the bubble in general and don't even like having a tweet get far outside of it. So I have an illegible bio, mostly hang around in replies etc. Very conflicted about whether this is good or stupid.

  	      4. I'm generically bad at asking for help. Getting better, but still bad. Hate 'bothering' people. So a bunch of things that would abstractly be good ideas are really hard for me to actually do.
